This is an unfinished Nonogram game project.
If you are not familiar with nonograms, you can find more about them here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram

Current build supports creating and solving nonograms, showing right and wrong tries, saving nonograms locally (and even sharing them by sending .nono files), showing hint numbers (how much unbroken lines are in a row or a column).
